###List of Technologies Used###:computer:
1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Javascript


###Installation Instructions###
My Portfolio uses Javascript so that has to be installed on my user's system. I used Github Pages for deployment.

###User Stories###:thumbsup:
1. As a non-technical recruiter, I want to see recommendations from previous employers, peers, and educators so I can validate that the candidate is appropriate for the hiring position.

2. As a product manager, I want to quickly find the candidates previous projects so I can assess if their work is cohesive with our companies expectations.

3. As a friend or family member, I want to easily navigate my friends portfolio so I can see what they have been learning and building since changing careers to a software engineer.

###Unsolved Problems and Major Hurdles###:fire:
I struggled with getting multiple event listeners to run. On different html pages I had different event listeners ('click' and 'mouseover') and only one would work at a time. If I commeneted either of the two out, the other would work. I was really not sure how to solve this problem. I struggled with getting the site to be responsive. I made sure to check frequently if it was working on smaller screens, but it took a lot of adjusting to make it look the best.
